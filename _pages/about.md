12/14th Westside Scout Group is an adventurous and active Scout group based near Balham. 

We're a fun, youth led group who have been going strong for over a century. We get out and camp as often as we can. Our four day Easter Camp Extravaganza with all sections is the highlight of our year.

We meet either at St Luke's Church Community Hall on Ramsden Road, or Broomwood Methodist Church off Kyrle Road. We have strong connections with the communities of both churches however our sections are open to anyone regardless of religious or non-religious alignment. 

Our volunteers are from a mix of backgrounds: younger adults who grew up in Scouting and have moved to London for work; Young Leaders in their teens who hav  previously been members of our sections and parents from the local area who volunteer while their children are members (but often enjoy it enough to stick around even after their kids age out!).
