12/14th Westside Scout Group is an adventurous and active Scout group based near Clapham South. We're made up for five sections covering ages 6 to 14, with over 100 youth members. All through the year, we're up to interesting activities which build skills for life:
- Regular meetings during term time
- Camps and nights away for all age groups, including our annual Group Easter camp with all sections
- Community events, such as taking part in the annual Nightingale Walk to raise funds for other local causes
