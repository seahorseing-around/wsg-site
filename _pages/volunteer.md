**We wouldn't be able to do what we do without adults like you.**

![Leader providing instruction on rifle shooting](/assets/images/IMG_8767.jpg){: .align-right width="400" max-width="100%"}

Our adult volunteers are a friendly group at the heart of our community. Giving back will improve your wellbeing, equip you with skills for the future, and help you make a positive impact on the lives of young people.

There are two main types of roles at Westside:

- [Section leaders and assistants](#role-descriptions---frontline-roles), who run our meetings, camps and activities.
- [Behind the scenes supporters](#role-descriptions---supporting-roles), enabling all of that to happen.

Scroll down to find role descriptions for some of the help we're looking for.

If you can only occasionally help, that’s OK. Whether you’d like to be an activity planner, tea-maker or craft creator, we appreciate any time you can spare. In fact, almost all of our roles can be flexible to suit your other commitments.

Neither do you need to have any 'traditional' scout skills, such as tying knots or reading maps, before joining us - all you need is enthusiasm to get stuck in, and we can support you to learn new things if you want.

At Scouts we celebrate difference and welcome everyone. Whatever your background, identity or ability, there’s a volunteer spot with your name on it.

## Role descriptions - supporting roles

### Lead Volunteer

The Lead Volunteer manages and supports the Scout Group and its Leaders to ensure it runs effectively and that Scouting within the Group develops in accordance with the rules and policies of The Scout Association. They provide a strategic direction for other volunteers. 
The most important skill for a successful Lead Volunteer is the ability to manage adults effectively - no prior knowledge of traditional ‘scout skills’ or Scout Association rules is necessary! There is scope to delegate many parts of the role, or to formally share responsibility with formal Deputy Lead Volunteers.

- Ensure that the Scout Group thrives and has the best systems in place to support adult volunteers and develop the Group – including a Group Trustee Board and Section leadership teams.
- Provide line management and support to the Leaders in the Scout Group, including setting objectives for their work and holding regular reviews and one-to-one meetings.
 -Ensure that the Scout Group has an adequate team of supported and appropriate adults working effectively together and with others to meet the Scouting needs of the area.
- Ensure that a challenging, exciting and balanced programme is offered to young people in the Scout Group.
- Work with other Lead Volunteers in the District to ensure that the District thrives and supports Scout Groups.

### Marketing Lead

The Marketing Lead helps demonstrate the great work we do within the group, to support the group to grow sustainably - in the short term, this means a particular focus on recruiting new adult volunteers! This is a flexible role, without any regular commitments, but which could be grown to meet your interests. There would be considerable opportunities to be creative, but materials are already available from HQ so it would also suit someone who enjoys reaching out to new people.

- Lead in the creation and dissemination of advertising materials to help grow the group sustainably.
- Help section leaders to expand the group’s social media presence (optional)
