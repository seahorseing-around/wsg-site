**Jump in and get muddy. Give back and get set. Scouts ignore the butterflies and go for it, and soon so will you.**

Our Scouts are a go-getting group of young people who master new skills, make new friends and explore the world around them, every Tuesday night. 

We run a varied programme of activities, pushing our young people to work together better, try new crafts, and explore their own values. We're lucky to have such a green neighbourhood and make regular use of the local commons.

In addition to regular troop nights, we go camping two to three times a year. This includes our group Easter camp, where all sections get together, and a Winter camp under canvas, where the challenge from the weather is part of the fun!

_Please note that, due to the high demand from our existing cubs, our scout section is not currently taking anyone off the waiting list. Visit the [South London Scouts website](https://join.southlondonscouts.org.uk/) to find other local scout groups._
