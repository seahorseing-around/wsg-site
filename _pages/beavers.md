**Try new things. Make new friends. Join Beavers to begin your big adventure!**

![A picture of an excited beaver before an activity"](/assets/images/IMG_0021.jpg){: .align-right width="360px" max-width="100%"} 

Beavers is the start of your scouting journey and a great place to try new things. Every week, they hop, skip and jump their way through lots of different games and activities â€“ achieving anything they set their minds to, and having lots of fun along the way.

Our Beavers:

- Explore the great outdoors, including the opportunity for at least one night away from home every year
- Try new activites and learn new skills - picking up stuff they couldn't learn in school by exploring, playing and doing
- Help others, working as a team to make changes big and small
