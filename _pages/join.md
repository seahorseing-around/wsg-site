*We experienced a partial loss of data on our waiting list in 2020 due to an incomplete transition between systems - if you signed up before this date, it may be necessary to complete our waiting list form again. Please get in touch if you might have been affected by this or you aren't sure whether your child is on our waiting list.*

## Aged 14 to 18?
We accept a small number of youth members aged 14 to 18 to take part in our young leaders scheme, supporting with regular evenings, camps and events. Not only does it help build your skills, it's also great fun! Plus, it can be a great way to complete the volunteering sections of your Duke of Edinburgh Award.

To find out more, please email [gsl@westsidescouts.org](mailto:gsl@westsidescouts.org?subject=Young leader enquiry).

We are not directly affiliated with any Explorer Units, the Scout Associaton's section for 14 to 18 year olds. For more information about nearby Explorer Units, visit the [South London Scouts website](https://southlondonscouts.org.uk/get-involved-become-scout/everyday-adventure-and-skills-life-scouting-6-25-year-olds/explorer). 

## Aged 18+?

Each week, our volunteers help young people gain skills for life through activities and adventures. 

  Your time and skills can make a difference in so many ways - no previous experience required!
