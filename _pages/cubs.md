**Develop new skills. Soar to great heights. Being a Cub opens up a whole other world.**

![A picture of cubs playing a game involving chairs](/assets/images/chairs.jpg){: .align-right width="400px" max-width="100%"} 

Every Tuesday, our two packs take part in challenges, crafts, activites and games which push them as individuals and as teams - growing and learning in small but mighty ways.

Cubs work as a team to help other people. Together, they learn about global and local issues and what they can all do to help solve them.

In addition to regular use of local green spaces, our Cubs normally go camping twice a year - a fantastic opportunity to forge new adventures away from home and get to know the great outdoors by being surrounded by it.
